    <h1>Go WASM to JS Comparison</h1>
    <p>
        Eventually this'll have JS and Go+WASM implementations of random functions, like a basic calculator or array
        manipulation, and compare their speed.
    </p>
    <p>
        But for now I'm focusing on getting infrastructure working. Like the static site generation, http server for
        local development, deployment pipeline, and hosting.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is, more than anything, an excuse to play with Go in various contexts - command line tooling, static site
        generation, a basic calculator implementation, and some WASM.
