    <h1>Go WASM Calculator</h1>
    <p>
        Eventually this'll have JS and Go+WASM implementations of calculator
        functions, and compare their speed.
    </p>
    <p>
        But for now I'm focusing on getting infrastructure working.
        Like the static site generation, http server for local development, and hosting.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is, more than anything, an excuse to play with Go. In various
        ways - a command line tool, a static site generator, a classic
        calculator, and some WASM.
